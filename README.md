# RayEmb

This repository contains the code for the paper "RayEmb: Arbitrary Landmark Detection in X-Ray Images Using Ray Embedding Subspace," accepted as an oral presentation at ACCV 2024.

## Overview

RayEmb introduces a novel approach for detecting arbitrary landmarks in X-ray images using ray embedding subspace. Our approach represents 3D points as distinct subspaces, formed by feature vectors (referred to as ray embeddings) corresponding to intersecting rays.
Establishing 2D-3D correspondences then becomes a task of finding ray embeddings that are close to a given subspace, essentially performing an intersection test.
